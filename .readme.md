# home
home directory (~) config files like .zshrc, .vimrc, .gitconfig

# assumptions
- home directory `~` is a git repo
   -  (with everything ignored, except the config files I want everywhere, like .zshrc, .vimrc, .gitconfig and .tmux.conf)
- shell is zsh
- operating system agnostic
   - I run this on WSL2 (Ubuntu) on Windows, on MacOS, on Arch Linux, and on OpenSUSE Linux (Leap and Tumbleweed), and probably Raspbian soon.

# dependencies
- zsh
- git
- ssh
- zenity # for gui dialogs

# features
- *flowlog* is a script I wrote to log what I'm working on, it's there to allow me to quickly make a note without losing my flow. This is for helping me retrace my steps as I pursue problems in the course of my work. In Ubuntu, I bound it to <F9>
- the zsh prompt uses `RPROMPT` to show the git repo status to the right


# why?
- I work across lots of operating systems, and the small differences between them can be annoying. I created this repo so I can have a common operating layer that I don't have to think about. For OS-specific things, I will use those things. For example, anything involving Swift and iOS will be done in Xcode on macOS. My CAD work is all done in Windows.
